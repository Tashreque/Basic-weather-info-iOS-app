# Basic-weather-info-iOS-app
This app uses the library CoreLocation and its class CLLocationManager to get the coordinates of the current position and use them to get weather information of the current location. Darksky API was used for this purpose, and it's json was parsed to decode required weather information about the current positional coordinate.

Note: This App is to only showcase swifts use of JsonDecoder and structs to parse json data from API calls, so UI elements were not focused on.
